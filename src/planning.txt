Basic Instructions:
Using React, create a SPA for Thomas Jefferson Elementary School. 
They need an admin dashboard that will let the staff manage student 
enrollment (enroll, assign class and teacher, 
basic information of the student). 
Use Firebase to keep track of the different people 
(student, admin, teacher) 
and what class the teachers and students are assigned.

Next steps:
Add Firebase authentication so that only admins can log in and 
change the page

Allow teachers to log in and see a view-only 
version of the dashboard that will let them see 
what students are in which class and basic information 
about the students
Make it pretty
Host it
